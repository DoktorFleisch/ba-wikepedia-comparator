    "History": "Python invented the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica ( CWI ) the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his `` permanent vacation'' from his responsibilities as Python's `` benevolent dictator for life'' ( BDFL ), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker ( he has since come out of retirement and is self-titled `` BDFL-emeritus'' ). January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project. Python 2.0 released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0 released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3. Python 2.7's end-of-life initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements be released for it. Currently only 3.9 and later are supported ( 2023 security issues were fixed e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release ). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. `` 2.7.18+'' ( plus 3.10 ), with the plus meaning ( at least some ) `` backported security updates''. 2021 ( and again twice 2022, and September 2024 for Python 3.12.6 down to 3.8.20 ), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure ( including 2.7 ) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution and web-cache poisoning. 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and 3.8.13, because of many security issues. When Python 3.9.13 released May 2022, it announced that the 3.9 series ( joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7 ) would only receive security fixes the future. On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14. Every Python release since 3.5 has added some syntax to the language. 3.10 added the | union type operator and the match and case keywords ( for structural pattern matching statements ). 3.11 expanded exception handling functionality. Python 3.12 added the new keyword type. Notable changes 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting. Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60 % faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5 % on top of that. It has improved error messages, and many other changes. Python 3.13 introduces more syntax for types, a new and improved interactive interpreter ( REPL ), featuring multi-line editing and color support; incremental garbage collector ( producing shorter pauses for collection programs with a lot of objects, and addition to the improved speed 3.11 and 3.12 ), and experimental just-in-time ( JIT ) compiler ( such features, can/needs to be enabled specifically for the increase speed ), and experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables the global interpreter lock ( GIL ), allowing threads to run more concurrently, that latter feature enabled with python3.13t or python3.13t.exe. Python 3.13 introduces some change behavior, i.e. new `` well-defined semantics'', fixing bugs ( plus many removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods, and removed some of the C API and outdated modules ): `` The [ old ] implementation of locals ( ) and frame.f_locals is slow, inconsistent and buggy [ and it has ] has many corner cases and oddities. Code that works around those may need to be changed. Code that uses locals ( ) for simple templating, or print debugging, continue to work correctly.'' Since 7 October 2024, Python 3.13 is the latest stable release, and 3.13 and 3.12 are the only versions with active ( as opposed to just security ) support and Python 3.9 is the oldest supported version of Python ( albeit the'security support' phase ), due to Python 3.8 reaching end-of-life. Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support ( up from one and a half ); followed by 3 years of security support ( for same total support as before ). Some ( more ) standard library modules and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, be removed Python 3.15 or 3.16. Python 3.14 ( now alpha 1 ) has changes for annotations, with PEP 649 `` [ preserving ] nearly all existing behavior of annotations from stock semantics''.",
    "Design philosophy and features": "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming ( including metaprogramming and metaobjects ). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is known as a glue language, able to work very well with many other languages with ease of access. Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution ( late binding ), which binds method and variable names during program execution. Its design offers some support for functional programming the Lisp tradition. It has filter, mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules ( itertools and functools ) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML. Its core philosophy is summarized the Zen of Python ( PEP 20 ), which includes aphorisms such as: Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Readability counts. However, Python features regularly violate these principles and have received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms are that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been controversial that Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life following vitriol over the addition of the assignment expression operator Python 3.8. Nevertheless, rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach. Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice their coding methodology. contrast to Perl's `` there is more than one way to do it'' motto, Python embraces a `` there should be one\u2014and preferably only one\u2014obvious way to do it.'' philosophy. practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve the same task. There are, for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote: `` To describe something as'clever' is not considered a compliment the Python culture.'' Python's developers usually strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases speed at the cost of clarity. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. It is possible to cross-compile to other languages, but it either does n't provide the full speed-up that might be expected, since Python is a very dynamic language, or a restricted subset of Python is compiled, and possibly semantics are slightly changed. Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected its name\u2014a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python\u2014and occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms `` spam'' and `` eggs'' ( a reference to a Monty Python sketch ) examples, instead of the often-used `` foo'' and `` bar''. A common neologism the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. `` Pythonic'' code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.",
    "Syntax and semantics": "Python is meant to be easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.",
    "Indentation": "Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. increase indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.",
    "Statements and control flow": "Python's statements include: The assignment statement, using a single equals sign = The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif ( a contraction of else-if ) The for statement, which iterates over iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true The try statement, which allows exceptions raised its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses ( or new syntax except * Python 3.11 for exception groups ); it ensures that clean-up code a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use object-oriented programming The def statement, which defines a function or method The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager ( for example, acquiring a lock before it is run, then releasing the lock; or opening and closing a file ), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization ( RAII ) -like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom The break statement, which exits a loop The continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next The del statement, which removes a variable\u2014deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined The pass statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create empty code block The assert statement, used debugging to check for conditions that should apply The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function ( and operator ); used to implement coroutines The return statement, used to return a value from a function The import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used the current program The match and case statements, analog of the switch statement construct, that compares expression against one or more cases as a control-of-flow measure. The assignment statement ( = ) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing\u2014in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type. Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.",
    "Expressions": "Python's expressions include: The +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions Python: floor division ( or integer division ) // and floating-point/division. Python uses the * * operator for exponentiation. Python uses the + operator for string concatenation. Python uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times. The @ infix operator. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication. The syntax: =, called the `` walrus operator'', introduced Python 3.8. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. Python, == compares by value. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities ( comparison by reference ), and comparisons may be chained\u2014for example, a < = b < = c. Python uses and, or, and not as Boolean operators. Python has a type of expression named a list comprehension, and a more general expression named a generator expression. Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression each body. Conditional expressions are written as x if c else y ( different order of operands from the c? x: y operator common to many other languages ). Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [ 1, 2, 3 ], are mutable, and can not be used as the keys of dictionaries ( dictionary keys must be immutable Python ). Tuples, written as ( 1, 2, 3 ), are immutable and thus can be used as keys of dictionaries, provided all of the tuple's elements are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to ( 1, 2, 3 ), executing t = t + ( 4, 5 ) first evaluates t + ( 4, 5 ), which yields ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ), which is then assigned back to t\u2014thereby effectively `` modifying the contents'' of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples unambiguous contexts. Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned ( to a variable, writable property, etc. ) are associated identical manner to that forming tuple literals\u2014and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign assignment statement. The statement expects iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions; when iterated through them, it assigns each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left. Python has a `` string format'' operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings C\u2014e.g. `` spam= % s eggs= % d'' % ( `` blah'', 2 ) evaluates to `` spam=blah eggs=2''. Python 2.6+ and 3+, this supplemented by the format ( ) method of the str class, e.g. `` spam= { 0 } eggs= { 1 }''.format ( `` blah'', 2 ). Python 3.6 added `` f-strings'': spam = `` blah''; eggs = 2; f'spam= { spam } eggs= { eggs }'. Strings Python can be concatenated by `` adding'' them ( with the same operator as for adding integers and floats ), e.g. `` spam'' + `` eggs'' returns `` spameggs''. If strings contain numbers, they are added as strings rather than integers, e.g. `` 2'' + `` 2'' returns `` 22''. Python has various string literals: Delimited by single or double quotes; unlike Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages, single and double quotes work the same. Both use the backslash ( \\ ) as escape character. String interpolation became available Python 3.6 as `` formatted string literals''. Triple-quoted ( beginning and ending with three single or double quotes ), which may span multiple lines and function like here documents shells, Perl, and Ruby. Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. ( Compare `` @ -quoting'' C #. ) Python has array index and array slicing expressions lists, denoted as a [ key ], a [ start: stop ] or a [ start: stop: step ]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted\u2014for example, a [: ] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy. Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example: List comprehensions vs. for-loops Conditional expressions vs. if blocks The eval ( ) vs. exec ( ) built-in functions ( Python 2, exec is a statement ); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements Statements can not be a part of expression\u2014so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, can not contain statements. A particular case is that assignment statement such as a = 1 can not form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.",
    "Methods": "Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method ( argument ) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method ( instance, argument ). Python methods have explicit self parameter to access instance data, contrast to the implicit self ( or this ) some other object-oriented programming languages ( e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, Ruby ). Python provides methods, often called dunder methods ( due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores ), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, arithmetic operations and type conversion.",
    "Typing": "Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined ( for example, adding a number to a string ) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class ( for example, SpamClass ( ) or EggsClass ( ) ), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type ( itself instance of itself ), allowing metaprogramming and reflection. Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes ( both using the same syntax ): old-style and new-style; current Python versions only support the semantics of the new style. Python supports optional type annotations. These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. Mypy supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.",
    "Arithmetic operations": "Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators ( +, -, *, / ), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % ( where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4 % -3 == -2 ). It has * * for exponentiation, e.g. 5 * * 3 == 125 and 9 * * 0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix\u2011multiplication operator @. These operators work like traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix ( + and - can be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively ). The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time: Current Python ( i.e. since 3.0 ) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 == 2.5. The floor division // operator introduced. 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division causes a module used Python 2.7 to use Python 3.0 rules for division ( see above ). Python terms, / is true division ( or simply division ), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division. Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation ( a + b ) //b == a//b + 1 is always true. It means that the equation b * ( a//b ) + a % b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a % b is, as expected, the half-open interval [ 0, b ), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie the interval ( b, 0 ] when b is negative. Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses round to even: round ( 1.5 ) and round ( 2.5 ) both produce 2. Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round ( 0.5 ) is 1.0, round ( -0.5 ) is \u22121.0. Python allows Boolean expressions with multiple equality relations a manner that is consistent with general use mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c. Python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. The Fraction class the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers. Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.",
    "Programming examples": "`` Hello, World!'' program: Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer:",
    "Libraries": "Python's large standard library provides tools suited to many tasks and is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications\u2014for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface ( WSGI ) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333\u2014but most are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. As of 17 March 2024, the Python Package Index ( PyPI ), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 523,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:",
    "Development environments": "Most Python implementations ( including CPython ) include a read\u2013eval\u2013print loop ( REPL ), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately. Python comes with Integrated development environment ( IDE ) called IDLE, which is more beginner-oriented. Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention, and syntax highlighting. As well as standard desktop integrated development environments including PyCharm, IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio Code etc, there are web browser-based IDEs, including SageMath, for developing science- and math-related programs; PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial IDE emphasizing scientific computing.",
    "Development": "Python's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal ( PEP ) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered PEP 8. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council. Enhancement of the language corresponds with the development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues were originally discussed the Roundup bug tracker hosted at by the foundation. 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub January 2017. CPython's public releases come three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented: Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently\u2014version 3.0 released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 is very unlikely to ever happen. Major or `` feature'' releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to happen annually. Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release. Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are patched these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented. Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development. The major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies. Python 3.12 removed wstr meaning Python extensions need to be modified, and 3.10 added pattern matching to the language. Python 3.12 dropped some outdated modules, and more be dropped the future, deprecated as of 3.13; already deprecated array' u' format code emit DeprecationWarning since 3.13 and be removed Python 3.16. The' w' format code should be used instead. Part of ctypes is deprecated and http.server.CGIHTTPRequestHandler emit a DeprecationWarning, and be removed 3.15. Using that code already has a high potential for both security and functionality bugs. Parts of the typing module are deprecated, e.g. creating a typing.NamedTuple class using keyword arguments to denote the fields and such ( and more ) be disallowed Python 3.15.",
    "API documentation generators": "Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc ( available as part of the standard library ), Sphinx, Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz, among others.",
    "Naming": "Python's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently Python code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. The official Python documentation contains various references to Monty Python routines. Users of Python are sometimes referred to as `` Pythonistas''. The prefix Py- is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of Simple DirectMedia Layer to Python ( commonly used to create games ); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written Python.",
    "Popularity": "Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked the top ten most popular programming languages the TIOBE Programming Community Index where as of December 2022 it the most popular language ( ahead of C, C++, and Java ). It selected as Programming Language of the Year ( for `` the highest rise ratings a year'' ) 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 ( the only language to have done four times as of 2020 ). Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify, and some smaller entities like Industrial Light & Magic and ITA. The social news networking site Reddit written mostly Python. Organizations that partially use Python include Discord and Baidu.",
    "Uses": "Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g. via mod_wsgi for the Apache webserver. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle, and Zope support developers the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used ( for example ) by Dropbox. Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python scientific computing, with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. OpenCV has Python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing. Python is commonly used artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, scikit-learn and the Logic language ProbLog. As a scripting language with a modular architecture, simple syntax, and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing. The combination of Python and Prolog has proved to be particularly useful for AI applications, with Prolog providing knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities. The Janus system, particular, exploits the similarities between these two languages, part because of their use of dynamic typing, and the simple recursive nature of their data structures. Typical applications of this combination include natural language processing, visual query answering, geospatial reasoning, and handling of semantic web data. The Natlog system, implemented Python, uses Definite Clause Grammars ( DCGs ) as prompt generators for text-to-text generators like GPT3 and text-to-image generators like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion. Python can be used for graphical user interface ( GUI ) by using libraries like Tkinter. Python has been successfully embedded many software products as a scripting language, including finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modelers like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts ArcGIS. It has been used several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go. Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4 ( using Python 2.7 ), FreeBSD ( as a package ), NetBSD, and OpenBSD ( as a package ) and can be used from the command line ( terminal ). Many Linux distributions use installers written Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Linux and Fedora Linux use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python its package management system, Portage. Python is used extensively the information security industry, including exploit development. Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, developed at Sugar Labs as of 2008, is written Python. The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language. LibreOffice includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.",
    "Languages influenced by Python": "Python's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages: Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model. Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its Acknowledgements document lists Python first among languages that influenced it. CoffeeScript, a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax. ECMAScript\u2013JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python. GDScript, a scripting language very similar to Python, built-in to the Godot game engine. Go is designed for the `` speed of working a dynamic language like Python'' and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays. Groovy motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java. Julia designed to be `` as usable for general programming as Python''. Mojo is a non-strict superset of Python ( e.g. still missing classes, and adding e.g. struct ). Nim uses indentation and similar syntax. Ruby's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, has said: `` I wanted a scripting language that more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language.'' Swift, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax. Kotlin blends Python and Java features, minimizing boilerplate code for enhanced developer efficiency. Python's development practices have been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language ( Python, a PEP ) is used Tcl, Erlang, and Swift."
