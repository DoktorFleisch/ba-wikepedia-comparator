    "Evolution": "The immediate ancestors of bees were stinging wasps the family Crabronidae, which were predators of other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. This same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within the vespoid wasps, where the pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors. Based on phylogenetic analysis, bees are thought to have originated during the Early Cretaceous ( about 124 million years ago ) on the supercontinent of West Gondwana, just prior to its breakup into South America and Africa. The supercontinent is thought to have been a largely xeric environment at this time; modern bee diversity hotspots are xeric and seasonal temperate environments, suggesting strong niche conservatism among bees ever since their origins. Genomic analysis indicates that despite only appearing much later the fossil record, all modern bee families had already diverged from one another by the end of the Cretaceous. The Melittidae, Apidae, and Megachilidae had already evolved on the supercontinent prior to its fragmentation. Further divergences were facilitated by West Gondwana's breakup around 100 million years ago, leading to a deep Africa-South America split within both the Apidae and Megachilidae, the isolation of the Melittidae Africa, and the origins of the Colletidae, Andrenidae and Halictidae South America. The rapid radiation of the South American bee families is thought to have followed the concurrent radiation of flowering plants the same region. Later the Cretaceous ( 80 million years ago ), colletid bees colonized Australia from South America ( with offshoot lineage evolving into the Stenotritidae ), and by the end of the Cretaceous, South American bees had colonized North America. The North American fossil taxon Cretotrigona belongs to a group that is no longer found North America, suggesting that many bee lineages went extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. Following the K-Pg extinction, surviving bee lineages continued to spread into the Northern Hemisphere, colonizing Europe from Africa by the Paleocene, and then spreading east to Asia. This facilitated by the warming climate around the same time, allowing bees to move to higher latitudes following the spread of tropical and subtropical habitats. By the Eocene ( ~45 mya ) there already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages. A second extinction event among bees is thought to have occurred due to rapid climatic cooling around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, leading to the extinction of some bee lineages such as the tribe Melikertini. Over the Paleogene and Neogene, different bee lineages continued to spread all over the world, and the shifting habitats and connectedness of continents led to the isolation and evolution of many new bee tribes.",
    "Fossils": "The oldest non-compression bee fossil is Cretotrigona prisca, a corbiculate bee of Late Cretaceous age ( ~70 mya ) found New Jersey amber. A fossil from the early Cretaceous ( ~100 mya ), Melittosphex burmensis, initially considered `` extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea sister to the modern bees'', but subsequent research has rejected the claim that Melittosphex is a bee, or even a member of the superfamily Apoidea to which bees belong, instead treating the lineage as incertae sedis within the Aculeata. The Allodapini ( within the Apidae ) appeared around 53 Mya. The Colletidae appear as fossils only from the late Oligocene ( ~25 Mya ) to early Miocene. The Melittidae are known from Palaeomacropis eocenicus the Early Eocene. The Megachilidae are known from trace fossils ( characteristic leaf cuttings ) from the Middle Eocene. The Andrenidae are known from the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, around 34 Mya, of the Florissant shale. The Halictidae first appear the Early Eocene with species found amber. The Stenotritidae are known from fossil brood cells of Pleistocene age.",
    "Coevolution": "The earliest animal-pollinated flowers were shallow, cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, the syndrome of insect pollination well established before the first appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. a process of coevolution, flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most species have scopal hairs on their hind legs or on the underside of their abdomens. Some species the family Apidae have pollen baskets on their hind legs, while very few lack these and instead collect pollen their crops. The appearance of these structures drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms, and, turn, bees themselves. Bees coevolved not only with flowers but it is believed that some species coevolved with mites. Some provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; return, it is believed that mites eat fungi that attack pollen, the relationship this case may be mutualistic.",
    "Characteristics": "Bees differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae ( hairs ), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences limb structure, and the venation of the hind wings; and females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates. Bees have the following characteristics: A pair of large compound eyes which cover much of the surface of the head. Between and above these are three small simple eyes ( ocelli ) which provide information on light intensity. The antennae usually have 13 segments males and 12 females, and are geniculate, having elbow joint part way along. They house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch ( mechanoreceptors ), smell and taste; and small, hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement as to `` hear'' sounds. The mouthparts are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of mandibles and a long proboscis for sucking up nectar. The thorax has three segments, each with a pair of robust legs, and a pair of membranous wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised flight, and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting. The largest species of bee is thought to be Wallace's giant bee Megachile pluto, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres ( 1.54 ). The smallest species may be dwarf stingless bees the tribe Meliponini whose workers are less than 2 millimetres ( 0.08 ) length.",
    "Bees population decline": "Over the last half century, there has been a general decline the species richness of wild bees and other pollinators, probably attributable to stress from increased parasites and disease, the use of pesticides, and a general decrease the number of wild flowers. Climate change probably exacerbates the problem. This is a major cause of concern, as it can cause biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation as well as increase climate change."
